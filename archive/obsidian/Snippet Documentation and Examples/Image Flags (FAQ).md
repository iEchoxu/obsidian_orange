# FAQ and Other items: 

## What about Color Flags?
Color Flags are limited due to how CSS is rendered. The non-technical version is that color selection is limited outside a few use cases. Changing the colors of other objects is better done by editing the CSS. 

## Do These Work with Other Themes?
The short answer is Yes
While some themes may cause behaviour that is "interesting" with snippets, most should be overcome with some basic settings tweaking. I've currently tested the snippets with a few themes without any issue an no need to change settings. 

## How Do I get Help? 
You can message me on github or through discord (Lithou#7447). I'm active on the obsidian forums and discord as well if you have a question you think others could benifit from.
