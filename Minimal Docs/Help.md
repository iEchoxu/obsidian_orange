## Become a sponsor

Use [Buy me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/kepano) or [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/kepano) to support development of Minimal. This helps me keep Minimal up to date with the latest improvements to Obsidian, and continue to work on bug fixes and features.

## Bug reports

Submit new issues on [the GitHub repo](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-minimal). Before you submit a bug report please follow these steps:

1. Update to the latest version of Minimal theme, update your plugins, and restart the app
2. Make sure the bug can be reproduced with plugins and snippets disabled
3. Make sure the bug *cannot* be reproduced with the default Obsidian theme
4. Search [open issues](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-minimal/issues) to make sure the bug hasn't been reported before
5. Paste your debug info into the issue report. It can be accessed in Obsidian with `CTRL/CMD-P`, enter "Show debug info", and click "Copy to clipboard"

## Feature requests

Submit new requests on [the GitHub repo](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-minimal). Before you request a feature search [open issues](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-minimal/issues) to make sure it hasn't been requested before.

Only submit feature requests that Minimal can address. For general Obsidian feature requests, use the [Obsidian Forum](https://forum.obsidian.md/). For improvements to plugins please go to the specific plugin's GitHub repo for instructions.

## Compatibility with community CSS snippets

Obsidian makes it easy to create and load your own [[CSS snippets]]. Countless snippets are available from members of the Obsidian community, but not all are guaranteed to work with Minimal.

Use community snippets at your own risk. Minimal is not tested for compatibility with community snippets. If you run into an issue with a snippet, contact the snippet author.
