Obsidian 0.16+ introduces a revamped window frame for the new Tabs feature. With [[Minimal Theme Settings]] you can now activate the Colorful frame toggle (also available as a [[Hotkeys|hotkey]]). This is especially useful if you use multiple Obsidian vaults and would like to color-code them. The color is automatically derived from your preference in the new Accent color in Obsidian Appearance settings, but you can also customize it further via [[Style Settings]] plugin.

**Light mode**
