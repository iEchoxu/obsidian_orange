Using [[Minimal Theme Settings]] you can define the following preferences which are useful in combination with [[Block width]]:

- **Normal line width:** the width of a normal line of text (default 40em)
- **Wide line width:** the width for "wide" elements (default 50em)
- **Maximum line width:** the maximum percentage of width that content can fill inside of a pane (default 88%)

To use these features, you will need to turn on "Readable line length" in Obsidian's Editor settings.

## Developers

You can visualize line width settings using the command `Dev â€” Show block widths` in Minimal Theme Settings.
