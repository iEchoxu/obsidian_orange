## Custom color schemes

You can use the [[Style Settings]] plugin to customize your color scheme.

To see your changes more easily, open Style Settings in a new pane by using the command palette (`CMD + P` by default). Using Style Settings you can customize Minimal's colors, font sizes, font styles, and many more details.

## Advanced color schemes

If you are comfortable with writing CSS, you can easily create your own color scheme [[CSS snippets]]. Explore the structure of the [Nord color scheme CSS](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-minimal/blob/master/src/scss/color-schemes/nord.scss) for example. For reference on what each CSS variable does, see [[Style Settings]].
