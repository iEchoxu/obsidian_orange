## Minimal for Obsidian Desktop and Mobile

Minimal for Obsidian apps is licensed under the [MIT License](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-minimal/blob/master/LICENSE) which allows you to modify and redistribute the code, however you must preserve the copyright and license notice in your CSS file. This includes any code you may extract as standalone [[CSS snippets]].

Minimal is frequently updated to stay current with the latest version of Obsidian. To make it easy to stay current with the latest improvements, I recommend using [Github's fork feature](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) so that you can merge the latest changes into your fork. If you have any questions don't hesitate to reach me in the Obsidian Discord group.

## Minimal for Obsidian Publish

[[Minimal for Obsidian Publish]] is a separate version of Minimal which follows the same design principles but is optimized for web. It is also licensed under MIT.
