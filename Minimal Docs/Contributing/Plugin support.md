#contributing

Plugin authors and developers can add support for Minimal theme by submitting a pull request to the [Minimal repo on GitHub](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-minimal).

The [src/scss/plugins](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-minimal/tree/master/src/scss/plugins) directory offers examples of [[CSS snippets]] for plugins that are currently supported. See [[Local development]] instructions.
