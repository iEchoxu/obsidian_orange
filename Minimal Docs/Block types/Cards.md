## Helper classes

To use Cards, add the `cards` or `list-cards` [[Helper classes|helper class]] on a note. Because Cards use [[Tables]] behind the scenes, they are also compatible with [[Block width]] table options.

The following helper classes are available to further customize cards in a specific note. The classes are composable, but `cards` or `list-cards` must be present for the other classes to work.
