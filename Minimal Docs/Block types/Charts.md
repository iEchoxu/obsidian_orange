Charts can be created using the [[Charts plugin]] and Tracker plugin.

As of Charts v3.2.3 you can turn on **Enable Theme Colors** in the Charts plugin settings. This enables your charts to automatically use the [[Color schemes]] preferences for **Extended palette** in [[Style Settings]].

Examples below show Gruvbox, Solarized and Dracula
