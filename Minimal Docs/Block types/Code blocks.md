#blocks 

Code blocks are compatible with [[Color schemes]]. You can define your own syntax highlighting scheme via [[Style Settings]] plugin.

Note that Obsidian uses two different syntax highlighting libraries in Reading vs Editing mode, so the syntax highlighting may have some inconsistencies depending on the language you use.
