#blocks 

Embeds, also known as [transclusions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transclusion) allow you to include a note or a block in the flow of another note. See how it works in the [official Obsidian documentation](https://help.obsidian.md/How+to/Embed+files).

## Strict embeds

By default, embeds are indicated visually with a border. However, you can also enable "strict embeds" which removes styling, making transclusions appear seamlessly in the flow of text.

Use [[Style Settings]] plugin to enable strict embed globally.

## Helper classes

Use [[Helper classes]] to control embed styling at the note level.

| Class             | Description                                         |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `embed-strict`    | Transclusions appear seamlessly in the flow of text |
| `embed-underline` | Transcluded text is underlined                      |
